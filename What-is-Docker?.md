From the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/what-docker):
> Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.

More high-level information about Docker can be found on the [Moby project README](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/README.md). Technical documentation can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/).
