# Documentation

The full documentation is available on the [repository wiki](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki).  
A good place to start is to understand [why NVIDIA Docker](Why NVIDIA Docker?) is needed in the first place.

# Quick start

Assuming the NVIDIA drivers and Docker are properly installed (see [[installation]]):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

# Initial setup
sudo make install
sudo nvidia-docker volume setup

# Run nvidia-smi
nvidia-docker run nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi
```
